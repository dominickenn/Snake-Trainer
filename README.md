# Snake-Trainer
A Local Hill Climbing algorithm to train an agent to play snake

Chris DeLeon of Gamkedo's(Youtuber) code from his video "Coding "Snake" in 4 min 30 sec (plain browser JavaScript)" was used as a base for the snake game.

The game was then improved on to allow for a trainer to be built to learn a snake agent.

Training sessions consisted of a 8 hour period.

As of 19/6/2018, the top scoring agent managed to clear 51 apples.
